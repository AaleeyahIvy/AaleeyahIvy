## About Me: Future Fullstack Engineer!
I enjoy drawing, writing, playing games and most importantly coding. Also, reading books can be pretty fun, so that too.

### Learning C#, JS, HTML, CSS, JAVA, SQL.
I'm currently working at IMS Company as a HTML Programmer using NetSuite and WYSIWYG to update forms and help switch ERPS. I graduated Tri-C with an associates of applied business and 3 certificates. My focus right now is learning more about data structures and algorithms, also learning bootstrap, react, handlebar.js, and sass.
