# .·:·.☽✧ Hi there, my name is Aaleeyah! ✧☾.·:·.

## About Me: Future Fullstack Engineer!
I enjoy drawing, writing, playing games and most importantly coding. Also, reading books can be pretty fun, so that too.

### Learning C#, JS, HTML, CSS, JAVA, SQL.
I'm currently studying programming and development at **Tri-C Community College**.
You can find me working on different small _assignments_ inbetween creating/building projects. I would love to collaborate and contribute to helping others through coding, and spreading my ideas everywhere. There is so much out there to explore so I am trying to learn as much as I can.
